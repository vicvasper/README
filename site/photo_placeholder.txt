Place your high-resolution original photo in site/photo_original.jpg. The included script scripts/crop-photo.js will generate:
- site/photo.jpg (resized color version, used by the HTML)
- site/photo_cropped.jpg (tightly cropped headshot variant)

If you prefer, you can upload both variants yourself.
