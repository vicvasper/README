PROFILE
Experienced Unreal Engine developer (C++ & Blueprints) with 5+ years delivering gameplay systems, editor tools, and runtime optimizations for indie and studio projects. Strong background building editor plugins, motion-capture pipelines, and performance tooling. Comfortable across the engine stack — gameplay, systems, and tooling — and focused on shipping robust, scalable code for AAA-quality production.

HIGHLIGHT
- PlayStation Talents — Best Narrative nominee (Azra) — 2021.
- Led design & development of a full motion-capture pipeline (real-time mapping and editor integration); worked on pioneering surf capture systems in Spain (NDA-protected client work).
- Creator/maintainer of multiple Unreal Engine plugins and systems (Optilogger, Kinemotion, SmartFolders, Procedural Animated System).

CORE SKILLS
- Engine: Unreal Engine 5 (C++ & Blueprints), editor plugin development
- Languages: C++, Python, C#, (HTML/CSS, basic Dart)
- Systems & areas: Gameplay systems, animation/mocap integration, multiplayer replication, editor tooling, performance profiling & optimization
- Tools: Git, GitHub Actions, Blender, Maya, Substance Painter, Visual Studio
- Other: Animation Blueprints, Level Sequencer, UI widgets, asset pipelines

EXPERIENCE
Unreal Engine Developer — Salascala / TheWiseDreams (Gran Canaria / Remote) — 2024–2025
- Developed motion-capture systems and integrations, including end-to-end pipelines for capture → retarget → editor workflows used across multiple projects.
- Built gameplay systems and replication logic for networked interactions, improving perceived player responsiveness in prototype builds.
- Led cross-discipline collaboration (design, animation, QA) to accelerate iteration cycles and reduce iteration time on animation fixes.
- NDA projects: worked on several studio R&D and prototyping projects (motion-capture, surf-capture research) — can discuss technical scope under NDA.

Game Programmer — Selene Games (Madrid) — 2024
- Implemented gameplay features and systems in UE5; contributed to core gameplay loops, input systems, and debugging tools.
- Improved level streaming and reduced load spikes by optimizing asset streaming strategies (editor tooling and runtime changes).

Game Programmer — Team Panda (Vigo) — 2021–2022
- Lead programmer for gameplay systems on Azra (PlayStation Talents finalist). Implemented platformer mechanics, physics interactions, and console optimizations.
- Implemented profiling-driven performance improvements and iterative bug fixes to meet platform constraints.

SELECTED PROJECTS
- The Noah Adventures (The Boltage Studio) — Gameplay programming, systems integration (2024 — in development).
- Kinemotion Plugin (UE5.3+) — Real-time full-body motion capture mapping using MediaPipe + Animation Blueprint integration. (Plugin + demo project)
- Optilogger (UE5.x) — Editor plugin for in-depth level resource analysis: meshes, textures, materials, animations, audio, lighting, post-process (profiling tools for optimization).
- Procedural Animated System (UE5.5) — C++ system for dynamic bridges and platform generation with automatic terrain detection and physics-driven animation.

EDUCATION
- Advanced development degree in UE5 (C++ & Blueprints), EOI — 2024–2025
- Game development degree in UE5 (C++ & Blueprints), EOI — 2023–2024
- Master’s in Digital Animation, Voxel School (Madrid) — 2021–2022
